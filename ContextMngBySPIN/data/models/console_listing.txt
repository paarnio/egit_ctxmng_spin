Template is CountPropertyConstraintTemplates------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#CountPropertyConstraintTemplates
-------- with comment:Abstract superclass of property constraints that compare the number of values with either min or max count.
Template is ConstraintTemplates------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#ConstraintTemplates
-------- with comment:Abstract superclass of templates that can be used as spin:constraints. The subclasses are expected to construct spin:ConstraintViolations and use ?this to talk about the instances of the associated class.
Template is BicycleNameTemplate2------- with URI:http://siima.net/ont/bicycle#BicycleNameTemplate2
-------- with comment:null
Template is UpdateTemplates------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spin#UpdateTemplates
-------- with comment:Suggested abstract base class for all UpdateTemplates.
Template is PropertyPairConstraintTemplates------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#PropertyPairConstraintTemplates
-------- with comment:Abstract base class for templates that take two properties as arguments and establish a relationship between them.
Template is UntypedObjectPropertyConstraint------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#UntypedObjectPropertyConstraint
-------- with comment:A generic SPIN template that can be used to declare a constraint that all values of a given property must have an rdf:type.
Template is ConstructDefaultValues------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#ConstructDefaultValues
-------- with comment:This template can be attached as spin:constructor to a root class such as rdfs:Resource to ensure that SPIN processors assign default values to certain properties. Looks for any templates attached as spin:constraints to the types of ?this and then assigns their declared spl:defaultValues.
Template is MyTemplate------- with URI:http://siima.net/ont/bicycle#MyTemplate
-------- with comment:null
Template is RegexPropertyConstraint------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#RegexPropertyConstraint
-------- with comment:null
Template is ConstructTemplates------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spin#ConstructTemplates
-------- with comment:Suggested abstract base class for all ConstructTemplates.
Template is Attribute------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#Attribute
-------- with comment:Defines an "attribute" of a class. Attribute definitions bundle common modeling patterns known from object-oriented languages like UML. Each attribute can have min and max cardinality, a value type and a default value. The attribute links a class with one RDF property. This template should be used as spin:constraints on a class to make sure that classes meet the expected cardinalities and valueType constraints.
If a model wants to use spl:defaultValue, then it should instantiate the spl:ConstructDefaultValues as a spin:constructor at some root class, such as rdfs:Resource.
Template is AllArguments------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#AllArguments
-------- with comment:Gets a list of all spl:Arguments declared at a given class and its superclasses.
Template is RunTestCases------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#RunTestCases
-------- with comment:Runs all spl:TestCases on the current model.
Template is PropertyConstraintTemplates------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#PropertyConstraintTemplates
-------- with comment:Abstract superclass of constraint templates that constrain exactly one property.
Template is Argument------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#Argument
-------- with comment:Provides metadata about an argument of a SPIN Function or Template. Arguments wrap a given rdf:Property (predicate) and specify its value type and whether the argument is optional. When used as spin:constraint, the body of this template will verify that a non-optional value exists and that it has the specified value type. Arguments that have been declared spl:optional true become optional if the type of ?this is spl:UnionTemplate. 
Template is InferDefaultValue------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#InferDefaultValue
-------- with comment:Can be used to infer default values for a given subject/predicate combination. This is typically assigned as spin:rule to a class. If ?this does not already have a value for a given property {?predicate}, then this will infer the value {?defaultValue}.
Template is SPINOverview------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#SPINOverview
-------- with comment:Finds all constraints and rules attached to classes in the current graph, using spin:constraint, spin:constructor, spin:rule or their sub-properties. The result set will contain the associated class, the predicate, and the SPIN rule.
Template is ObjectCountPropertyConstraint------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#ObjectCountPropertyConstraint
-------- with comment:Represents a constraint that can be attached to a class to specify that a given property must have between min and max values.

-------- with comment:null
Template is RangePropertyConstraint------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#RangePropertyConstraint
-------- with comment:Represents a constraint that narrows down a property by a minimum and maximum value compared by <= and >=.

Function is bnode------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/sp#bnode
-------- with comment:Constructs a blank node that is distinct from all blank nodes in the dataset being queried and distinct from all blank nodes created by calls to this constructor for other query solutions. If the no argument form is used, every call results in a distinct blank node. If the form with a simple literal is used, every call results in distinct blank nodes for different simple literals, and the same blank node for calls with the same simple literal within expressions for one solution mapping. This functionality is compatible with the treatment of blank nodes in SPARQL CONSTRUCT templates.
Function is in------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/sp#in

Function is isNumeric------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/sp#isNumeric
-------- with comment:Returns true if arg1 is a numeric value. Returns false otherwise. term is numeric if it has an appropriate datatype (see the section Operand Data Types) and has a valid lexical form, making it a valid argument to functions and operators taking numeric arguments.

Function is relevantPropertyAtClass------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spl#relevantPropertyAtClass
-------- with comment:A magic property that establishes a relationship between properties (left) and classes (right) to determine which properties are "relevant" for the class. Relevant means that they have the class in their domain and/or restrictions, including superclasses and sub-properties (unless they define their own domain). Domains consisting of an owl:unionOf are also handled.

Note that the performance of the body of this magic property has been optimized for the case in which the class is given, so ideally use this for queries such as  ?property spl:relevantPropertyAtClass skos:Concept .
Function is month------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/sp#month
-------- with comment:Extracts the month from a date/time literal.
Function is select------- with URI:http://spinrdf.org/spin#select

Example:

    (?query "this" owl:Thing) spin:select (?a ?b)

will execute the sp:Select or sp:Ask that ?query points to and pre-bind ?this with the value of owl:Thing for the execution of the query. The first result variable of the query's result set will be bound to ?a, the second to ?b etc. If the nodes on the right are bound (or constants) then it will match with the values from the result set.
